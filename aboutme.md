### Welcome!

![Profile Picture]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/profile-pic.jpg "Profile Picture")

My name is Zhou (Joe) Li and I am a data scientist at Apple. I received my Ph.D. in [Statistics at NC State University](http://www.stat.ncsu.edu/), where I worked with Dr. [Lexin Li](http://sph.berkeley.edu/lexin-li) on statistical methods for neuroimaging data analysis. Before moving to North Carolina, I grew up in [Nanjing](http://www.cityofnanjing.com/), China and earned a B.S. in mathematics from [Nanjing University](http://www.nju.edu.cn/english/). In my free time, I enjoy music, movies, running, reading and cooking.
