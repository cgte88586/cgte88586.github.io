My name is Zhou (Joe) Li and I am a data scientist at Apple. I received my Ph.D. in [Statistics at NC State University](http://www.stat.ncsu.edu/), where I worked with Dr. [Lexin Li](http://lexinli.biostat.berkeley.edu/index.html) on statistical methods for neuroimaging data analysis. Before moving to North Carolina, I grew up in [Nanjing](http://www.cityofnanjing.com/), China and earned a B.S. in mathematics from [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/EN/). In my free time, I enjoy music, movies, running, reading and cooking.
